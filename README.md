# dotfiles-25
Haven't stored much dotfiles lately. But want to keep common configuration between work and personal. Newer and more minimalistic


# Dots that I've kept in the past
1. Nix & NixOS
2. neovim
3. Terminal file
4. Doom Emacs (Loved it but wanna make life easier rn, spent way too much time messing with the configs)
5. File Explorers . Ranger is good but can be slow LS has some better alternative recommendations
6. Currently using Kitty for my terminal, feels pretty good for now. Has support for tabs and split without tmux although I do like a simple split configuration for the terminal tmux. I don't like the kitty icon though



SpaceMacs and the space configuration for vim isn't worth messing around with much. The vim mode on other editors isn't great. VSCode, and Evil mode is okayish. Working in vim mode in IntelliJ IDEA is NOT good
